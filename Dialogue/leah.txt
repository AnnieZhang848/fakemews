Leah : excited : How could you say no to that perfect little kitty?
Leah : neutral : And just think of what other advancements in human-animal relations are going to come of this!
Evan : sheepish : Fair enough, you are both cat people after all.
Evan : sheepish : And I suppose I should be more open-minded to new developments.
Leah : neutral : Hey, what's important is that we all learned a lot this week, right?
Evan : shocked : Oh, you mean in class?
Evan : sheepish : Uhh yeah, the logical fallacies and such...
Evan : complaining : I've been paying attention!
Leah : happy : Hahaha, never change Evan.
