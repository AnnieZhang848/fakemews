Leah : neutral : Say, we've spoken a lot about Bartholo-meow these past few days...
Leah : neutral : But you've never given your own opinion yet.
Evan : excited : Yeah, that's true!
Evan : concerned : You know that I'm not totally stoked about it.
Evan : complaining : After all, the technology is still very new and we can't be sure of all the effects quite yet.
Leah : happy : And you know that I totally love Bartholo-meow!
Leah : neutral : As far as we know, the scientists are taking lots of precautions to keep him safe and happy.
Leah : excited : So I'm super excited to see what's in store for the future and where this might go.
Evan : sheepish : I've also learned to be more open to other people's opinions and be cautious but not paranoid.
Leah : sheepish : And I'm trying to be less hostile towards those who don't share my opinion and to base my decisions more on facts, less on first reactions.
Evan : neutral : So now that it's been a week...
Leah : neutral : Where do you stand?
P : Hmm... What do I think?
P : Well...
