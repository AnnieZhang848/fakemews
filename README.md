Scientists have figured out how to engineer a talking cat and everyone is discussing it online, now it’s up to you to figure out who’s making legitimate arguments and who’s just trying to be the loudest person on the internet!

## Characterizing Goal
Teaching players how to recognize logical fallacies in online discussions and to think critically before engaging with arguments — especially those made in bad faith or by individuals more interested in spreading their opinions or misinformation, than in having meaningful dialogue.

To achieve this, we created an interactive, narrative-based game where players navigate a fictional controversy: scientists have created a talking cat named Bartholo-meow. Each day, after learning about logical fallacies in class, the player must apply their new knowledge to analyze social media posts that argue either for or against the cat’s existence. While the game presents no objectively “correct” stance on Bartholo-meow, players are challenged to identify flawed reasoning within the arguments they encounter. By doing so, they learn to base their conclusions on evidence and logic rather than emotionally charged or manipulative rhetoric.

## Game Premise, Objective and Rules
In a world not too different from our own, a scientific breakthrough has set the internet ablaze: a team of researchers has created the world’s first talking cat named Bartholo-meow. Discussions flood every corner of the internet. Some people are excited, praising this scientific human achievement or dreaming of conversations with their pets. Others are skeptical, outraged, or paranoid about the ethical implications. Caught in the middle of this digital storm is the player — a regular student navigating high school life, attending classes from Monday to Friday.

Each day, their teacher delivers a lesson on logical fallacies using simple examples and clear explanations to help students sharpen their reasoning. After each lecture, the player meets with either Leah, a passionate supporter of Bartholo-meow, or Evan, a vocal opponent. Both friends eagerly share online posts and comment threads from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, all centering on the talking cat debate. Hidden within these conversations are logical fallacies that distort reasoning and fuel
emotional arguments. The player’s objective is to carefully read the posts, identify the flawed arguments, and match them to the correct fallacy learned in class.

Progression through the game and story depends on the player's ability to spot and correctly label these fallacies. As the week unfolds, the player is exposed to a variety of perspectives, collects facts, and refines their ability
to think critically. Ultimately, the game challenges the player to form their own reasoned opinion about Bartholo-meow—not based on persuasion or emotional arguments, but on facts, evidence, and clarity.

## Game Mechanics
Story progression: The story advances day by day throughout the school week, each day unlocking new lessons on logical fallacies. Both allow the people to get into the narrative as they play out being a student and learning this information in school.

Identifying the fallacy: As players engage with the social media post, they choose portions of the post to match it to the fallacy being displayed. The use of social media posts serve as an environment where fallacies appear and interactions occur. The identification is done through an interactive point-and-click action for the player. Where they have to identify the statement that indicates a possible fallacy and then identify that fallacy.

Reference Tool/Notebook: This allows the user to look back and reference the fallacies they learned, acting as a bit of scaffolding.

Instant feedback: Players are given instant feedback as they progress to levels. Ensuring that they select the right answer before progressing to identifying the fallacy. By verifying the players selection it encourages them to think more critically about the social media post, a skill we hope they take away with them.
