I still don’t like this at all. Just because Bartholo-meow seems fine now doesn’t mean this won’t harm him in the long run. We’re playing with nature here. What happens when people start modifying more animals to talk? It could get out of control.

But the researchers have been careful. They said that Bartholo-meow is monitored constantly by veterinarians, and he acts like a normal cat most of the time. The project wasn’t even about making him “human,” it was about seeing if communication is possible and safe. So far, it looks like it is.

eah, but one happy cat doesn’t prove it’s safe. Genetically modified animals always end up suffering eventually. This won’t be any different.
