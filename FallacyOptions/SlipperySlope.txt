Mark my words: this is how it starts. First, we have Bartholo-meow, the “cute” talking cat. Next thing you know, scientists will be giving every pet a voice, then genetically altering wild animals, and soon we’ll have talking bears demanding rights and lawyers. This is the first step towards chaos. We should not be messing with nature like this.

That’s not actually what the scientists are doing. The official report said this is a single controlled experiment with no plans to mass-produce talking animals. The project focused only on Bartholo-meow to study animal communication, and the cat is being monitored closely by veterinary experts. There’s no slippery slope happening.

While it’s not as dramatic as Dennis says, it’s also true that the research paper mentioned some unintended side effects, like minor vocal strain and occasional disorientation in Bartholo-meow. The scientists admitted they don’t fully understand the long-term effects yet. So, it’s not chaos, but it’s also not risk-free
